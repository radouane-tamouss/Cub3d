Map parsing and validateing: 

- [ ] the map must be composed only of only 6 possible characters :
    => 0 for an empty space
    => 1 for a wall
    => N,S,E or W fot the player's start position and spawning orientation.
    => te map must be closed/surrounded by walls
    => Except for the map content,each type of element can be separated by one or more empty line(s).
    => Except for the map which always has the be the last, each type of element can be set in any order in the file.
    The map must be parsed as it looks in the file. Spaces are a valid part of the map and are up to you to handle. You must be able to parse any kind of map, as long as it respects the rules of the map.

These are examples of valid map files.

I wont talk much about the texture and colors here.
Unlike so_long, the rules of the map are laxed and allowing more creative freedom. The map will may not be rectangular in shape and may have many weird edges/curves and corners. However, the map can still be parsed as a 2d
character array and treated like normal strings with different lengths each row.
Comment

As such, I came up with a few map validation rules. Assume that we are scanning the map from top to bottom, left to right :

Ignore all leading whitespaces.
If the current row is the 0th row or the final row, only accept '1's and ' 's.
else, The first and final character should always be a '1'.
In the case of any non leading whitespaces, the only acceptable characters adjacent to the space are '1's or ' 's.
If strlen(curr_row) > strlen(row_on_top) && current col > strlen(row_on_top), current character should be '1'
If strlen(curr_row) > strlen(row_on_bottom) && current col > strlen(row_on_bottom), current character should be '1'
Those rules should pass all the map requirements given.
